1. Project Overview

This project is developed to create the backend APIs for an e-commerce application called ShoppyGlobe.
The backend is built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas.
JWT authentication is used to secure user access, especially for cart-related operations.

Using this backend API, the following operations can be performed:

User registration and login with authentication

Fetching all products from the database

Fetching details of a single product using product ID

Adding products to the shopping cart

Updating the quantity of items in the cart

Removing products from the cart

Viewing all cart items of a logged-in user

All cart-related APIs are protected routes and can only be accessed by authenticated users using a valid JWT token.

Key features implemented in this project:

Password hashing using bcrypt

Token-based authentication using JWT

Proper API error handling

MongoDB Atlas cloud database for data storage

2. Middleware Overview
a) Authentication Middleware

The authentication middleware is used to secure private routes such as cart APIs.
It checks the JWT token sent in the request headers.

If the token is valid, the request is allowed to continue

If the token is missing or invalid, the API returns 401 Unauthorized

Why this middleware is important?

Ensures only logged-in users can access cart data

Protects user-specific information

Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive routes

b) Error Handling Middleware

Error handling middleware is used to manage API errors gracefully.

Two main error handlers are used:

notFoundHandler

Triggered when a user tries to access a route that does not exist

Returns a message like:
“Route not found”

This helps in providing clear responses instead of server crashes.

Conclusion

This backend project helped in understanding how to build secure REST APIs using Node.js and Express.
It demonstrates authentication, database operations, middleware usage, and proper API structure for a real-world e-commerce applicatio
